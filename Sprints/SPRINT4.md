# Sprint 4

The objective of the sprint was to display notifications to users, including formalized match notifications that rank the top 8 most suitable candidates and CHA (Competencies, Skills, and Attributes) descriptions generated for the requested position. This aims to create a better user experience. Additionally, the sprint focused on implementing two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection and enabling password reset functionality in case of forgotten passwords.
