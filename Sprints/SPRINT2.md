# Sprint 2

The objective of Sprint was to develop Candidate Ranking. This functionality involves a list of all positions job registered in the company. From each position job, we generate a ranking of the 8 best candidates, classified by percentage and we also add new improvements to the load register, thus enabling users to improve and edit their searches on Chatgpt.
